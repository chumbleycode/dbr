\usage{
infer_db(ttT, ttT_sub = NULL, which_matrix = NULL,
  which_tfbms = NULL, explicit_zeros = FALSE, n_sim = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{ttT}{is a tidy "topTable" object, output from tidy_topTable}

\item{ttT_sub}{a subset - of rows - of the above, considered interesting in
some way.}

\item{which_matrix}{the TFBM matrix: "utr1", "exonic1_utr1", "exonic1"}

\item{which_tfbms}{a character vector of interesting binding motifs (cols of
which matrix)}

\item{explicit_zeros}{If TRUE, then create explicit zero counts in the tfbm
matrix for all genes in the sample frame that are not in tfbm database. If
FALSE, then only genes the set of genes with at least one binding motif for
at least one regulator.}

\item{n_sim}{the number of samples for the monte carlo inference}
