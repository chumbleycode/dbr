<!-- # The sample frame -->

<!-- Restrict sample frame for logical and computational reasons. DB is akin to an interaction effect: it asks whether differential RNA expression varies across genes with differing binding motif counts. With no variation in the underlying RNA expression, the meaning and power of DB is diminished. We therefore propose to restrict the sample frame to only genes which can be differentially expressed (e.g. via filterByExpr() in edgeR). -->

<!-- In additional, for laborious non-parametric methods, we may further restrict to genes with at least one motif for at least one regulator. -->

# The universe of genes and binding-motifs

The broad goal is to relate RNA expression to DNA binding motifs. The universe or domain of our RNA expression data is the set of genes for which we have a meaningful estimate of differential expression between exposure groups. The universe of our DNA binding motif loci data is the set of loci in open chromatin which host any motif targeted by at least one known whole-blood factor (Brandt). These loci can be further divided according to the exact region of the gene in which the loci resides: in the start region, in some exonic region, or both. The specific goal is then to relate the per-gene loci count for a known regulator (DNA) to the amount of differential expression observed in RNA.

# Revisiting TeLiS

The goal of TeLiS was to implicate some gene expression regulator - say CREB3 - in the observed pattern of gene expression over treatment groups. The approach has three steps. In step 1 we identify a sampling frame of $n_g$ genes and label a subset of $k < n_g$ of these genes "differentially expressed"\footnote{This is the set of genes whose differentially expression we can estimate. We therefore ignore, for example, genes with little or no variation in expression over subjects.}. Step 2 uses external bioinformatic information to evaluate the average number of CREB3 DNA binding motifs within our subset of "differentially expressed" genes\footnote{We here define as "motif" any binding site with high affinity for either one or two transcription factors cooperatively. We use the notation $a$, $b$ and $a::b$ for motifs binding to $a$,$b$ or both respectively.}. In step 3 we compare this latter with the average number of CREB3 motifs in a $random$ subset or sample of $k$ genes from the entire population of $n_g$ genes. This assumes a parametric, frequentist hypothesis testing framework: yeilding a p-value about the representativeness of our $k$ sample. This p-value reveals whether our gene set contains a suprising number of motifs, which is itself taken as circumstantial evidence that CREB3 mediated differential expression. TeLiS therefore complements and extends traditional gene-by-gene analyses with DNA information.

# More detail

Steps 2 and 3 exploit publically available DNA data repositories that allow us to calculate the number of binding motifs, $m_{ij}$, for each transcription factor $j$ within each gene $i$. This dna data can be arranged as a gene x motif matrix $\textbf{M} = (m_{ij})$. $\textbf{M}$ is an $n_g \times n_b$ matrix linking our gene population $i \in \{1,2,...,n_g \}$ to the set of binding motifs $j \in \{1,2,...,n_b \}$. Note that $m_{ij}=k p_{ij}$ where $k$ is the total number of positions on the genome that host a regulator and $p_{ij}$ is the share of all these sites that bind regulator $j$ in gene $i$.

Let $\omega$ denote our set of $k$ "differentially expressed" genes. For example, we define $\omega$ to be the top ranking $k = 100$ differentially expressed genes. Then $\{m_{ij}: i \in \omega \}$ is the corresponding set of $k$ motif counts for regulator $j$ in each of these differentially expressed genes. This is simply the relevent $k$ rows of the $j$th column of $\textbf{M}$.  Let $T_{\omega j}:=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i \in \omega}m_{ij}$ denote the per-gene $mean$ number of motif binding sites in $\omega$. We will use $T_j$ as notational shorthand for this latter quantity, but the dependence on $\omega$ is implied. If $T_j$ is "relatively large", then the gene set is relatively enriched with motif $j$. Intuitively, this motif is then implicated as a possible root cause of the observed differential gene expression which characterizes $\omega$. In the sense discussed above, $T_j$ may then be interpreted as a test of differential regulation by $j$. 

The original parametric null distribution for $T_j$ implicitly assumed that the number of binding sites within each of our $k$ genes is independently and identically distributed: each being the (random) number of sites found in a single gene sampled uniformly at random with replacement from the entire gene population. We postpone the question of biological dependence between genes and note that sampling is only approximately independent or identically distributed because genes are in fact sampled without replacement from a finite sample frame. This may be relevant when the sample frame is relatively small, or in calculating statistics other than the average motif enrichment discussed above. In fact one can easily use (non-parametric) Monte Carlo sampling without replacement to calculate the null distribution of any statistic, e.g. the mean differential effect within all genes targeted by a transcription $\sum_i \theta_{i}[m_{ij}>0]$, where $\theta_{i}$ is an estimate of the per-gene differential expression measure, $m_{ij}$ in the motif count of regulator $j$ in gene $i$ and $[\cdot ]$ is Iverson notation for the indicator function. 

Simple random sampling without replacement from the gene population provides one possible outcome $\omega$ from the sample space $\Omega_{n_g,k}$ of $\binom{n_g}{k}$ possible gene sets of cardinality $k$ within a gene population of size $n_g$. Now $T_j$ is a random variable\footnote{$T_j:\Omega_{n_g,k}\to \mathbb Q_{\geq 0}$ with domain $\Omega_{n_g,k}$ and codomain the set of non-negative rational numbers.} whose null distribution is therefore functionally determined by our null hypothesis on $\Omega_{n_g,k}$. The null hypothesis we consider is equivalent to $\omega \sim U(\Omega_{n_g,k})$: i.e. the gene set is chosen uniformly at random from $\Omega_{n_g,k}$. Then the chance of each an every gene set is just $1/|\Omega_{n_g,k}|=1/\binom{n_g}{k}$, where $|\cdot|$ is the set cardinality function. Then $P(T_{j}=t|n_g,k)= \frac{1}{|\Omega_{n_g,k}|}\sum_{\omega \in \Omega_{n_g,k}}[T_{\omega j}=t]$, where $[\cdot]$  is the boolean indicator function. Classical tests and p-values then follow simply, for example by finding a critical value $t: P(T_j \geq t)=\alpha$ or, recalling that we have already defined a set of enrichment scores $\{T_1,T_2,..T_k\}$, choosing $t:P(\cup_j \{T_j\geq t\})=\alpha$ which controls the family-wise error rate, etc. 

Because $|\Omega_{n_g,k}|$ is too large to conveniently enumerate, we pursue a simple Monte Carlo approximation: sample $100000$ times from $\Omega_{n_g,k}$ and determine the corresponding approximate null distribution for $T_j$.  Computationally, we calculate $100000$ samples from the null distribution as (the collumns of) $(\textbf{Q}* \textbf{M})/k$, where $\textbf{M}$ is still our $n_g \times n_b$ gene x binding motif matrix and $\textbf{Q}$ is a $10000 \times n_g$ matrix whose boolean rows each indicate one of $100000$ elements sampled uniformly at random without replacement from $\Omega_{n_g,k}$. If we observe a relatively high value $t_j$, relative to this Monte Carlo null distribution we conclude that there is "over-representation" of a regulator in promoters of differentially expressed genes, and we report a one-tailed p-value gauging statistical significance.

Recall our two assumptions, fixed $n$ and random sampling of gene sets $\omega$. The former assumption is inconvenient when $n$ is itself chosen adaptively based on the data. To avoid redefining our sample space, so that $n$ is formally a random variable, we follow other authors and simply condition all inference on $n$ (see below for details on defining $\omega$). The latter assumption seems strong: expression of genes is clustered or correlated, so it would seem that not all $\omega$ are equally likely as assumed by  $\omega \sim U(\Omega_{n_g,k})$. Yet recall that $\omega$ is selected based on differential expression, so it is only relevant whether the gene-specific estimators of differential expression are clustered or correlated. We assume that two estimators are correlated if and only if some co-regulator is responsible for their coordinated differential expression. But then there will be no correlation or clustering between estimators under the null hypothesis, all $\omega$ will be equally likely and $\omega \sim U(\Omega_{n_g,k})$ appears defensible. 


# Revisiting step 1: preselecting a gene set 

We have shown how to test whether individual motifs are implicated in differential expression. This avoids a key question of ambiguity: if two regulators A and B are declared significant, A may be causally responsible for $\omega$ while B may be spurious. B simply has a similar (confounded) motif count pattern across genes to A. TeLiS does not offer such adjustments. This section proposes an alternative which both reduces these false positives - due to this confounding - and false negatives, due to insufficient power. The latter is possible by pooling data over $all$ $n_g$ genes in the gene population - not just the $k$ genes in TeLiS - into the estimation of a single scalar parameter. 

To do this we relax the requirement that genes be first labeled as DE (or not): this classification is heuristic and looses information. We instead attempt to predict variation in the estimated differential expression $\theta_i$ across $all$ $n_g$ genes in the gene population. For a fixed our regulator of interest $j$, we correlate $j's$ motif count over genes $m_{ij}$ with the estimated gene-by-gene DE estimates $\theta_i$. This can be achieved via some non-parametric or linear regression model $E(\theta_i|m_{ij})=a+b_jm_{ij}$. The parameter $b_j$ amounts to an interaction term, wherein the effect of some exposure on gene expression itself depends on the motif density, i.e. larger in genes with more motifs for $j$. From a multilevel modeling perspective, the parameter $b_j$ might also be viewed as a second level regression parameter controlling the effect of motif density on the (first level) gene-specific random effects which relate between-subject exposure variation to between-subject variation in the expression of the specific gene. The regression function for subject $s$ of gene $i$ on exposure $x_s$ is $E(y_{is}|x_s, z_s) = \alpha + \theta_{i}x_{s} + C$, with $C = \sum_k b_{ki} z_{ks}$ the linear effect of some covariates $\{z_{k}\}$. One benefit of a linear approach is that we can easily infer the partial effect of transcription factor $j$ on differential\ expression, adjusting for the potentially confounding effect of other transcription factor(s). This is just $E(\theta_i|M)=a+\sum_jb_jm_{ij}$. This may help with avoiding falsely attributing differential expression to one regulator $j$ when there exist other canditates with a similar/confounded motif counts over genes. Such motif covariation can be directly inspected in this linear framework, while it is harder to study in any approach based on preselecting genes (see appendix). Note also the increased power: this approach pools data over all genes and subjects into the estimation of a single scalar parameter $b_j$. 

# Appendix

# The TFBM matrix

In this work we only require that some part of the regulator binding motif $j$ overlaps with the 1000 base pairs upstream of the gene $i's$ transcription start site, yet other conditions might be equally applied (such as whether the regulator is in an exon). 

# Discriminating different regulators based $\omega$

Recall that each transcription factor complex acts on it's regulator within a subset of the genome. If each gene contained only one regulatorw, then in principle we could perfectly reverse engineer which regulator underlies a given activated gene set: a gene set could contain only one regulator's motif. But there is a "many to many" (not a functional) relationship between the set of genes to the set of motifs, so we can discuss the dissimilarity, distance or divergence between the distributions of distinct regulators $j,j'$, i.e. different columns of $\textbf{R}$, as $D(m_{\cdot j}, m_{\cdot j'})$ for some definition of $D$. The distance between any two regulators dictates if they are more or less discriminable. If $t_{\omega j}$ denotes the "sub-column" $m_{\cdot j}$ identified by the observed gene set $\omega$, then $D(m_{\omega j}, m_{\omega j'})=D_{jj'}$ relates the discriminability of different regulators and is a set of $\binom{n_m}{2}$ random variables for each pair of regulators (or $\textbf{D}$ is a random distance matrix). This in turn determines the correlations between the regulator-specific p-values discussed in the introduction. In case of high correlation, the specificity of inference is necessarily weaker.

<!-- Recall that $\textbf{R} = (t_{ij}) = (k \times p_{ij})$. We then use $p_{i|j}, p_{j|i}$ to denote the conditional distribution over all genes of given regulator $j$, and the conditional distribution of over all regulators of a given gene $i$. Correspondingly, $p_{\cdot j}$ $p_{i \cdot}$ are marginal distributions akin to the (unnormalized, integer-valued) $t_{\cdot j}$ $t_{i \cdot}$. -->

<!-- FROM TELIS PAPER: -->
<!-- At the most immediate level, it should be possible to identify the specific -->
<!-- transcription factors mediating observed changes in gene expression based on -->
<!-- the prevalence of their characteristic TFBMs in the promoters of co-regulated -->
<!-- genes. -->


<!-- We focus on the distinct problem of surveying known TFBMs to identify the specific factors driving observed changes in gene expression. -->

<!-- Reverse inference of transcription factor activity. -->


<!-- Most genes are regulated through the coordinated actions of multiple -->
<!-- transcription factors, so the presence of a single TFBM in a gene’s promoter -->
<!-- does not guarantee that it will be expressed even if its cognate transcription -->
<!-- factor is activated (Mitchell and Tjian, 1989; Wagner, 1999; Carey and Smale, -->
<!-- 2000; Holmes and Bruno, 2000; Chiang et al., 2001). -->

<!-- Conversely, the absence of a TFBM for a given factor does not ensure the -->
<!-- absence of regulation because many transcriptional dynamics are mediated -->
<!-- indirectly by secondary waves of transcription factor activity (e.g. factor A -->
<!-- induces the expression of factor B, and factor B subsequently activates -->
<!-- promoters bearing no consensus binding site for factor A). -->

<!-- This problem is compounded by the fact that current analyses can severely -->
<!-- underestimate the number of genes showing true differential expression (Cole -->
<!-- et al., 2003). All these dynamics effectively contaminate the group of -->
<!-- ‘unregulated control’ promoters with genes that should actually be assigned to -->
<!-- the ‘differentially expressed’ subset, and vice versa. Such -->
<!-- cross-contamination is known as the ‘errors in variables’ problem in the -->
<!-- statistical literature, and it can profoundly degrade analytic accuracy -->
